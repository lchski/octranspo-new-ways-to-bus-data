Certainly! Here are some ways to analyze the cross-source comparisons:

1. Categorize similarities:
   - Group the results into different similarity ranges (e.g., 0.8-0.85, 0.85-0.9, 0.9-0.95, 0.95-1.0).
   - Analyze each group separately to understand the types of differences occurring at each similarity level.

2. Investigate high-similarity, different-code pairs:
   - Focus on pairs with very high similarity (e.g., > 0.95) but different stop codes.
   - These might represent the same physical stop with slight naming differences between sources.

3. Analyze naming patterns:
   - Look for consistent differences in naming conventions between sources (e.g., "St." vs "Street", "Nth" vs "North").
   - Use this information to create standardization rules for your data.

4. Check for transposition errors:
   - Identify cases where the stop names are very similar but have characters or words in a different order.
   - These could indicate data entry errors in one of the sources.

5. Examine code and ID relationships:
   - Look for patterns in how stop_codes and stop_ids relate between the two sources.
   - Are there any consistent mappings or differences?

6. Geographic analysis (if location data is available):
   - For highly similar stops, compare their geographic coordinates.
   - This can help confirm if they're truly the same stop or just similarly named distant stops.

7. Frequency analysis:
   - Count how many times each stop_name appears in the results.
   - Stops that appear frequently might have systemic naming issues.

8. Word-level comparison:
   - For stops with medium similarity (e.g., 0.8-0.9), break down the names into words and compare word by word.
   - This can help identify specific differences (added words, spelling variations, etc.).

9. Create a reconciliation list:
   - For high-similarity pairs, create a list of proposed matches between the two sources.
   - This can be a starting point for manual review or automated reconciliation.

10. Analyze unmatched stops:
    - After identifying potential matches, look at stops that don't have any close matches in the other source.
    - These could be unique to one source or have more significant naming differences.

11. Time-based analysis (if timestamp data is available):
    - Compare the creation or last update times of similar stops across sources.
    - This might reveal which source is more up-to-date or how data flows between sources.

12. Soundex or metaphone comparison:
    - In addition to Levenshtein distance, use phonetic algorithms to group similar-sounding names.
    - This can catch matches that sound the same but are spelled differently.

To implement these analyses, you might want to export the results to a spreadsheet or use additional SQL queries to dive deeper into specific aspects. You could also consider using data visualization tools to help identify patterns or anomalies in the data.

Would you like me to provide an example of how to implement any of these analysis methods using SQL?

Certainly! I'll provide SQL examples for word-level comparison (8), creating a reconciliation list (9), and analyzing unmatched stops (10).

1. Word-level comparison (8):

This query breaks down stop names into words and compares them:

```sql
WITH similar_stops AS (
  -- Your original query here, aliased as 'ss'
),
word_comparison AS (
  SELECT 
    ss.*,
    unnest(string_to_array(name1, ' ')) AS word1,
    unnest(string_to_array(name2, ' ')) AS word2
  FROM similar_stops ss
)
SELECT 
  name1, 
  name2, 
  similarity,
  SUM(CASE WHEN word1 = word2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matching_words,
  COUNT(*) AS total_words,
  ARRAY_AGG(CASE WHEN word1 != word2 THEN word1 || ' <> ' || word2 END) AS different_words
FROM word_comparison
GROUP BY name1, name2, similarity
ORDER BY similarity DESC, matching_words DESC;
```

This query will show you matching and different words between similar stop names.

2. Creating a reconciliation list (9):

This query creates a list of proposed matches with high similarity:

```sql
WITH similar_stops AS (
  -- Your original query here, aliased as 'ss'
),
best_matches AS (
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT ON (name1)
    name1, 
    code1, 
    id1, 
    source1,
    name2, 
    code2, 
    id2, 
    source2,
    similarity
  FROM similar_stops
  WHERE similarity > 0.9  -- Adjust this threshold as needed
  ORDER BY name1, similarity DESC
)
SELECT *,
  CASE 
    WHEN code1 = code2 THEN 'Exact code match'
    WHEN similarity > 0.95 THEN 'Very high similarity'
    ELSE 'Potential match'
  END AS match_type
FROM best_matches
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

This query finds the best match for each stop in source1, allowing for easier reconciliation.

3. Analyzing unmatched stops (10):

This query finds stops that don't have any close matches in the other source:

```sql
WITH similar_stops AS (
  -- Your original query here, aliased as 'ss'
),
matched_stops AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT name1, source1 FROM similar_stops
  UNION
  SELECT DISTINCT name2, source2 FROM similar_stops
)
SELECT 
  s.stop_name, 
  s.stop_code, 
  s.stop_id, 
  s.source
FROM 
  stops s
LEFT JOIN 
  matched_stops ms ON s.stop_name = ms.name1 AND s.source = ms.source1
WHERE 
  ms.name1 IS NULL
ORDER BY 
  s.source, s.stop_name;
```

This query will show you all stops that don't have any close matches in the other source, which could indicate unique stops or stops with significant naming differences.

To use these queries:

1. Replace the `similar_stops` CTE in each query with your original query that finds similar stops across sources.
2. Adjust thresholds (like similarity > 0.9) as needed based on your data.
3. Modify column names if they differ from the ones used in these examples.

These queries will give you a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between your two sources, helping you identify patterns, potential matches, and stops that might need special attention during data reconciliation.

Would you like me to explain any of these queries in more detail or provide examples of how to interpret their results?

I apologize for the confusion. You're right to ask about this, as I didn't make it clear how to alias the original query. Let me show you how to do that properly.

To alias the original query as 'ss', you'll need to wrap your existing query in another CTE. Here's how you can structure it:

```sql
WITH original_query AS (
  -- Your original query goes here, exactly as it was
  WITH stop_pairs AS (
    SELECT 
      a.stop_name AS name1,
      a.stop_code AS code1,
      a.stop_id AS id1,
      a.source AS source1,
      b.stop_name AS name2,
      b.stop_code AS code2,
      b.stop_id AS id2,
      b.source AS source2,
      levenshtein(LOWER(a.stop_name), LOWER(b.stop_name)) AS distance
    FROM 
      stops a
      JOIN stops b ON LEFT(a.stop_name, 1) = LEFT(b.stop_name, 1)
    WHERE 
      a.source < b.source
      AND ABS(LENGTH(a.stop_name) - LENGTH(b.stop_name)) <= 3
  ),
  similarity_scores AS (
    SELECT 
      name1,
      code1,
      id1,
      source1,
      name2,
      code2,
      id2,
      source2,
      distance,
      1 - (distance::FLOAT / GREATEST(LENGTH(name1), LENGTH(name2))) AS similarity
    FROM 
      stop_pairs
    WHERE
      distance <= 5
  )
  SELECT 
    name1,
    code1,
    id1,
    source1,
    name2,
    code2,
    id2,
    source2,
    distance,
    ROUND(similarity::NUMERIC, 2) AS similarity
  FROM 
    similarity_scores
  WHERE 
    similarity >= 0.8
  ORDER BY 
    similarity DESC, distance
  LIMIT 
    100
),
similar_stops AS (
  SELECT * FROM original_query
)
-- Your new query goes here, using 'similar_stops' or 'ss' as the source
SELECT * FROM similar_stops ss;
```

Now, you can use `similar_stops` or `ss` as the alias for your original query results in any of the example queries I provided earlier. For instance, to use it with the word-level comparison query:

```sql
WITH original_query AS (
  -- Your original query here, as shown above
),
similar_stops AS (
  SELECT * FROM original_query
),
word_comparison AS (
  SELECT 
    ss.*,
    unnest(string_to_array(name1, ' ')) AS word1,
    unnest(string_to_array(name2, ' ')) AS word2
  FROM similar_stops ss
)
SELECT 
  name1, 
  name2, 
  similarity,
  SUM(CASE WHEN word1 = word2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matching_words,
  COUNT(*) AS total_words,
  ARRAY_AGG(CASE WHEN word1 != word2 THEN word1 || ' <> ' || word2 END) AS different_words
FROM word_comparison
GROUP BY name1, name2, similarity
ORDER BY similarity DESC, matching_words DESC;
```

This structure allows you to reuse the results of your original query in multiple subsequent analyses without having to repeat the entire query each time. You can now easily apply this pattern to the other example queries I provided earlier.

Creating a separate spreadsheet for manual reconciliation is an excellent approach. This allows for human judgment in cases where automated matching might be uncertain. Here's a suggested process:

1. Create a reconciliation spreadsheet:

Schema for the spreadsheet:
- id1 (from source 1)
- name1 (from source 1)
- code1 (from source 1)
- source1
- id2 (from source 2)
- name2 (from source 2)
- code2 (from source 2)
- source2
- similarity_score
- reconciled_id (to be filled manually)
- reconciled_name (to be filled manually)
- reconciled_code (to be filled manually)
- action (e.g., "merge", "keep separate", "delete")
- notes (for any comments or explanations)

2. Export the results of your similarity query to this spreadsheet:

```sql
WITH original_query AS (
  -- Your original similarity query here
)
SELECT 
  id1, name1, code1, source1,
  id2, name2, code2, source2,
  similarity,
  '' AS reconciled_id,
  '' AS reconciled_name,
  '' AS reconciled_code,
  '' AS action,
  '' AS notes
FROM original_query
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

3. Manually review and fill in the reconciled columns:
   - For each pair, decide if they should be merged, kept separate, or if one should be deleted.
   - Fill in the reconciled_id, reconciled_name, and reconciled_code with the final values.
   - Use the action column to indicate your decision.
   - Add any relevant information in the notes column.

4. Once the manual reconciliation is complete, import this spreadsheet back into your database as a new table, let's call it `stop_reconciliation`.

5. Use SQL to merge this reconciliation data back into your stops table:

```sql
-- Create a new consolidated stops table
CREATE TABLE consolidated_stops AS

-- First, include all reconciled stops
SELECT 
  r.reconciled_id AS stop_id,
  r.reconciled_name AS stop_name,
  r.reconciled_code AS stop_code,
  CASE 
    WHEN r.source1 < r.source2 THEN r.source1 
    ELSE r.source2 
  END AS original_source
FROM stop_reconciliation r
WHERE r.action = 'merge'

UNION ALL

-- Then, include stops from source1 that weren't merged
SELECT 
  s.stop_id,
  s.stop_name,
  s.stop_code,
  s.source AS original_source
FROM stops s
LEFT JOIN stop_reconciliation r ON s.stop_id = r.id1
WHERE s.source = (SELECT MIN(source) FROM stops)
  AND (r.id1 IS NULL OR r.action = 'keep separate')

UNION ALL

-- Finally, include stops from source2 that weren't merged
SELECT 
  s.stop_id,
  s.stop_name,
  s.stop_code,
  s.source AS original_source
FROM stops s
LEFT JOIN stop_reconciliation r ON s.stop_id = r.id2
WHERE s.source = (SELECT MAX(source) FROM stops)
  AND (r.id2 IS NULL OR r.action = 'keep separate');

-- Add any additional columns you need
ALTER TABLE consolidated_stops 
ADD COLUMN last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

This approach:
1. Creates a new `consolidated_stops` table.
2. Includes all reconciled stops that were marked for merging.
3. Includes stops from source1 that weren't in the reconciliation process or were marked to keep separate.
4. Includes stops from source2 that weren't in the reconciliation process or were marked to keep separate.
5. Adds a `last_updated` column for tracking changes.

After running this, you'll have a new `consolidated_stops` table that combines your two sources, with manual reconciliation applied where needed.

Remember to:
- Verify the results carefully.
- Consider creating a view instead of a table if you need to repeat this process regularly.
- Update any dependent queries or applications to use the new consolidated table.
- Implement a process for handling future updates to either source.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this process or provide additional SQL for managing the consolidated data?
